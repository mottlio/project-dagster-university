I would like you to create a dagster asset using a dlt source to access the Azure blob="credit_cards.csv" from the container = "creditcards". The AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING is currently stored in the .env file. I would like the dlt pipeline to load the contents of that file into the motherduck database. The database name and the connection token is already configured in the secrets.toml file.

Create two new dagster assets similar to dlt_azure_credit_cards. They will both pull data from the same Azure account and place it in the same MotherDuck database. The first one will pull data from the blob="interchange_fees.csv" in the container "interchangefees". The second one from the blob="merchant_service_fees.csv" in the container "merchantservicefees". Please think how this can be implemented without unnecessary duplication of code.
